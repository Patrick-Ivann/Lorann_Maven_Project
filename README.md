# Lorann_Maven_Project

**The Game**  
Created in 1985, Lorann is an arcade game that puts you in the shoes of Lorann. He must release the hundred-one crypts owned by the Mask of Nekron. To do this he must touch the Bubble Energy that is in each of them and will have the opportunity to find many treasures during his journey.

**Developpement**  
During a week and half our group has the mission to developp the game (Started Monday,28th May to Wednesday,6th June).

**Expected**  
During this week we had to provide a game wich display a map created by our group with a SQL connection (The maps are stocked in a database). We had to load the maps with the differents sprite provided and make some differents levels with inevitably **an Hero** (Lorann), **Enemy(s)**(daemons), **purse**(to get money) , **an Energy Cristal**(wich allow to open the gate) and **walls** (to delimit the map) and **a Gate** (allow you to win).

**How To Play**  

- *Movement*: You move your hero with the **arrow keys** on the keyboard  
- *Fire*: You can fire a fireball with **space key** in a straight line in order to kill demons and be alone to pick up all the treasure from the crypts
- *Purse*: Pick up the money and become rich. If you see a purse **run, walk on it** and the money is to you.  
- *Energy Ball*: Pick up the ball and the gate will oppen. Hurry up, **cross the door** without being touched by the daemons and the win is to you.
